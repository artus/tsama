This project was not intended to create a full-blown digital pet game, but rather a small exercise on learning Vue.js . The only purpose is to keep your Tsama alive by giving it food and love. When its health is low you can give it some medicine to heal your Tsama. Your Tsama will be saved in `LocalStorage`, to create a new Tsama you should press the slamm blue refresh button.
